UltraK9 Pro Ingredients?




One serving of UltraK9 Pro has these things:




Chicken Bone Broth (50mg)




To make chicken bone broth (or chicken stock), you have to cook the whole chicken with bones and cartilage. The result is a soup that has many vitamins and nutrients that are good for healthy joints.




These nutrients include omega fats and minerals like calcium, phosphorus, salt, and potassium. Also, the high amount of glycine has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, so it helps the body work better. Dogs can eat bone broth made from chickens.




Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate (50mg)




Collagen is a protein that is left in the bones and tissues of the body, as well as the skin, blood vessels, digestive system, and muscles. To get bovine collagen from cows, you have to boil cow meat in water. Then you can take out the collagen, dry it, and make it into powder for supplements. Bovine collagen is good because it has a lot of collagen types I and III, which are important for healthy cartilage and skin.




Astragalus Root Extract (25mg)




Astragalus extract is a plant that has been used in Chinese medicine for a long time to treat many problems, like improving breathing, reducing allergies, and boosting immunity.




Some people think that the benefits of Astragalus for humans can also help their dogs. But there is not enough evidence to prove it.




It may prevent harmful things from building up in the liver, help the liver cells grow back, and make the immune system stronger. Dogs with urinary problems, or dogs who have been stressed or abused, can benefit a lot from this plant for their breathing.
